# Tokenizer using FLEX

This repository contains a simple lexer implementation for a C-like programming language using Flex. The lexer reads input from a file named "input.c," tokenizes it, and categorizes various elements such as keywords, operators, identifiers, and more.

## Getting Started

To run the Lexer on your machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using Git
2. Navigate to the repository directory
3. Compile the lexer source code using GCC
4. Run the lexer on the sample input file "input.c"
The lexer will tokenize the input file and display the categorized elements based on the defined rules.

## Example Input

The provided "input.c" file contains a sample input code that the lexer will process.

## Features

- Recognizes keywords such as "if," "else," "int," "char," and more.
- Identifies arithmetic, assignment, and relational operators.
- Categorizes logical operators and strings enclosed in double quotes.
- Recognizes valid numbers and identifiers.
- Handles whitespace and various symbols.
